## Project Vision

In today's rapid AI development, Large Language Models (LLMs) show amazing capabilities, but securely and efficiently connecting them to massive existing business systems (REST APIs) remains a challenge.

**MCP-ANY-REST** was born for this. Our mission is to **bridge the gap between LLMs and business data**.

We are not just building a tool, but a bridge—a bridge that allows AI to understand and manipulate real-world data. By following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard, we enable any RESTful service to join the AI ecosystem with zero cost.

## Core Value

::: tip Write Once, Connect Anywhere
No need to repeat development for every AI model. Configure once, run everywhere.
:::

## Tech Stack

This project is built on a modern tech stack ensuring high performance and maintainability:

| Domain | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Rust |
| **Protocol Standard** | Model Context Protocol (MCP) |
| **Config Language** | ZML |
| **Doc Site** | VuePress + Theme Hope |
